Subjective Method uses anecdotes and "ah-ha" feelings that "resonate". 
No system for biases. Truth is what makes sense to the self.
Does not work with a partner or compile measurable (written) data. 

Peacocking is when in some way shape or form a person is seeing their Demons and thinks they are their Saviors. 
People are fascinated by their Demons and unconsciously want to be known for them.  

Anecdotes 
A person will point to an action and use it to prove a trait. 
"I'm very good at Intuition, therefore I'm Savior Intuition."
"I have a hard time with self and others, therefore I'm not a Double Decider."  

Objective Method knows that they are biased and uses experiments to falsify assumptions. Uses well defined terms and carefully learns a part at a time.
Works with a partner to produce measurable statistics over 60%.

# Saviors & Demons

## What we are NOT tracking   
We are not tracking words or performance in the moment. Everybody can do everything.  We are not tracking whether you are good or bad at, or like or hate your Saviors and Demons.  We see the Savior and Demon tracking game the same as we see lie detection.  For example, caring about others doesn’t mean you have Savior Fe.  Seeing and caring about the “bigger picture” doesn’t mean you have Savior Intuition.  

## What we ARE tracking  
We are tracking their fear or acceptance of the responsibility of a Function.  We are tracking the recurring life patterns that show up from time spent on Saviors / lack of time spent on Demons.  We watch for a person’s emotional spikes in context to the rest of their speech patterns.  If they spike emotion when talking about tribe related issues, we want to see that in context with how they manage control and chaos issues.

## Savior State   
RESPONSIBLE: I’m responsible, so I spend my time on this.  
CONFIDENCE: I can work through the struggles here.  
OBVIOUS: Let me just do that for you, thank me later.  
Because people spend the majority of their day in their Savior Functions, they can manage the ups and downs of those Functions.

## Demon State    
TIDAL WAVES: I'm not responsible, someone else is.  
FEAR/PAIN: Why does this keep happening to me?
PEACOCKING: I secretly want to be good at this.
Because people spend only a small portion of their day in their Demon Functions, there is no mastery there and they’ll show it in their emotions. 

# The 4 Human Needs  
The most important part in all the 512 personality code is the 4 Human Needs.  
We use the same 4 Human Needs as Tony Robbins with slightly different names.  
These are Identity, Gather, Organize, and Tribe.  Each Human Need is connected to a Function.

## Identity, Significance, Self (Fi & Ti)   
Prioritizes their personal values/reasons first, then seeks the spectrum of the tribe's values/reasons.
Identity is the main Human Need for the IxxP’s which is either lead Fi or Ti.

## Tribe, Validation, Connection (Fe & Te) 
Prioritizes the spectrum of the tribe's values/reasons, then seeks their personal values/reasons.
Tribe Validation is the main Human Need for the ExxJ’s which is either lead Fe or Te.   

## Organize, Control, Certainty (Si & Ni)   
Answers are found by going over known facts/concepts, then gathering in new facts/concepts later.
Organize is the main Human Need for the IxxJ’s which is either lead Si or Ni.

## Gather, Variety, New (Se & Ne)      
Answers are found by gathering new facts/concepts, then organizing known facts/concepts later.  
Gather is the main Human Need for the ExxP’s which is either lead Se or Ne.

## Single Observer (Double Decider)   
Relatively balanced with self and tribe, but feels stuck when it comes to control and chaos.
The ability to move back and forth on Decisions is what we call Double Deciding. Both the ExxP’s and IxxJ’s are Double Deciders.  This means they will be able to decide for themselves and for the tribe in a relative balance, compared to being able to observe and deal with control and chaos.

## Single Decider (Double Observer)  
Relatively balanced with control and chaos, but feels stuck when it comes to self and tribe.
The ability to move back and forth on Observations is what we call Double Observers. Both ExxJ’s and IxxP’s are Double Observers.  This means they will be able to observe the facts and abstract patterns in a relative balance, compared to being able to make decisions with emotions and reasons.


# Letters

# Feeling  
Looks to prioritize the value of something, then figures out the reasons. 
Feeling is the Function used to prioritize and process feelings and values. 
Those that have Savior Feeling will generally struggle with figuring out how things work.

# Thinking  
Looks to figure out the reasons of something, then figures out the priorities/values.
Thinking is the Function used to figure out things, puzzles, ideas, and how something works.  
Those that have Savior Thinking will generally struggle with processing emotions. 

# Sensing  
Looks for the provable facts first, then sees the abstract connections. 
Sensing is the Function used to track facts, details, data, statistics and see the relation of current information.  Those that have Savior Sensing will generally struggle with understanding the causes or the “why” behind things that occur.

# iNtuition  
Looks for abstract connections first, then sees the provable facts.
Intuition is the Function used to discover and understand why things are connected with abstract grouping and contextual pattern recognition.  Those that have Savior Intuition will generally struggle with tracking the details or trusting the facts.

# Observer Functions

The Observer Functions are responsible for processing the information in the world.  
There are the Introverted Observers (Oi) and the Extroverted Observers (Oe).  

## Extroverted Sensing (Se)  
Answers are found by gathering new facts, then organizing known concepts later.
Se is responsible to see the different information in the world and will get frustrated when having to go back to routine or the same repetitive pattern.  When solving problems, the Savior Se will prefer to seek out new experiences and new sources to find more facts and details.  They tend to seek freedom, and will not readily accept that they already have answers in their known patterns.

## Introverted iNtuition (Ni) 
Answers are found by going over previously known and accepted concepts, then gathering in new facts later.  Ni is responsible for narrowing down and limiting new facts and details coming in.
When solving problems, the Savior Ni will prefer to find answers in abstract concepts they are already familiar with, as opposed to seeking out new information.  They tend to seek control by planning and organizing with the same known theories again and again to create order. 

## Extroverted iNtuition (Ne)  
Answers are found by gathering new concepts, then organizing known facts later.
Ne is responsible to see the different patterns in the world and will get frustrated when having to go back to routine or old boring details.  When solving problems, the Savior Ne will prefer to seek out new experiences and new sources to find more theories and concepts.  They tend to seek freedom, and will not readily accept that they already have answers in their known details.

## Introverted Sensing (Si)   
Answers are found by going over previously known and accepted facts, then gathering in new concepts later.  Si is responsible for narrowing down and limiting new concepts or patterns coming in.  When solving problems, the Savior Si will prefer to find answers in facts and details they are already familiar with, as opposed to seeking out new concepts.  They tend to seek control by planning and organizing the same known details again and again to create order.


# Decider Functions 

The Decider Functions are responsible for prioritizing decisions for either the Self or the Tribe. There are the Introverted Deciders (Di) and the Extroverted Deciders (De). 

Introverted Feeling (Fi) prioritizes their personal values first, then seeks the spectrum of the tribe's reasons.  Savior Introverted Feeling will prefer to first ask themselves what is valuable, before asking for the tribe’s input on whether it makes sense.

Extroverted Thinking (Te) prioritizes the spectrum of the tribe's reasons, then seeks their personal values.  Savior Extroverted Thinking will prefer to first ask the tribe to figure out how things work, before asking themselves whether it is valuable.

Introverted Thinking (Ti) prioritizes their personal reasons first, then seeks the spectrum of the tribe's values.  Savior Introverted Thinking will prefer to first ask themselves whether an idea will work, before asking for the tribe’s input on whether it is valuable.

Extroverted Feeling (Fe) prioritizes the spectrum of the tribe's values, then seeks their personal reasons.  Savior Extroverted Feeling will prefer to first ask the tribe if something is valuable, before asking themselves whether it is an idea that makes sense.

# Animals

There are 2 Animal Coins which are made from a combination of 2 Functions.  
You must have 1 Decider Function and 1 Observer Function to make up an Animal.  
There’s the “Energy” Animal Coin of Sleep vs Play, and the “Information” Animal Coin of Consume vs Blast.

## Sleep (Di+Oi)  
Process and preserves energy for self, before expending energy for the tribe.
Sleep is the Introverted Energy Animal, and is responsible for stopping to go back over known information.  Those that have this high are constantly putting on the brakes to protect themselves.  
They tend to have a difficult time with getting things done earlier on in the day, and may spike in their energy later on in the evenings.  Those that have this low generally have a harder time stopping themselves and protecting their energy and the energy of those around them.  

## Play (De+Oe)   
Expends energy for the tribe, before processing and preserving energy for self.
Play is the Extroverted Energy Animal, and is responsible for getting things done while learning from the tribe.  Those that have this high are constantly moving, going, taking action, and trying to work with others.  They tend to have a difficult time with wasting energy earlier on in the day, and may need to crash later on in the evenings.  Those that have this low generally have a harder time performing tasks such as driving, shopping, or chores that require gathering and interacting with others.

## Consume (Di+Oe)   
Takes in and respects info, before getting started and teaching.
Consume is the Introverted Information Animal, and is responsible for taking in new information that they are interested in.  Those that have this high are constantly bored with old information and seek new things about what they love to learn.  They tend to have a difficult time starting projects because there is never enough new information to gather, often not finishing and moving on to the next thing.  Those that have this low will often have a shallow understanding of information, and are more willing to teach what they know even if the information isn’t valuable.

## Blast (De+Oi)    
Gets started and is able to teach, before respecting and gathering info.
Blast is the Extroverted Information Animal, and is responsible for taking their same known organized information and sharing it or teaching it.  Those that have this high are quick to communicate and get projects started as it isn’t necessary for them to gather in all the information first.  They will often unconsciously consume information and re-share it before they own it or know where it came from.  Those that have this low will often have a very difficult time communicating or getting new projects started.

# Sexual Modalities

There are 4 Sexual Versions of every single personality Type, and 4 Modalities that correspond with those Sexual Versions.  Everyone has 2 Feminine Functions and 2 Masculine Functions no matter if they are Savior or Demon.  

## Sensory & Extroverted Decider  
The Modalities are created by the Sensory Function & the Extroverted Decider.
It does not matter whether the Sensory Function or the Extroverted Decider is a Savior or Demon Function.  The first letter represents the Sensory Function, and the second letter represents the Extroverted Decider.  For example, a "FM" has Feminine Sensory and a Masculine Extroverted Decider. 

## Feminine Functions
All the Feminine Functions can be seen as movable and not wanting to shove or stand their ground.
Thinking will be moveable or non-solid on what is accurate or truth.
Feeling will be moveable or non-solid on what they feel or value.  
Intuition will be moveable or non-solid on what they see as the possible patterns.  
Sensing will be moveable or non-solid on what they see as the facts. 

## Masculine Functions
All the Masculine Functions are solid and shovey and are willing to fight to be non-moveable.
Thinking will be shovey or solid on what is accurate or truth.
Feeling will be shovey or solid on what they feel or value.  
iNtuition will be shovey or solid on what they see as the possible patterns.  
Sensing will be shovey or solid on what they see as the facts. 

## Feminine & Masculine Sensory  
Feminine Sensory vs Masculine Sensory is usually trackable by a person’s ability to track time and memories.  Those that have a linear more solid version of the past history are usually Masculine Sensory.  Those that have more fuzzy or visual impressions of the past are usually Feminine Sensory. 

## Feminine & Masculine Extroverted Decider
Feminine Extroverted Decider vs Masculine Extroverted Decider is usually trackable by a person’s ability to easily work with people.  Those that have a Feminine Extroverted Decider tend to be much more movable with people.  Those that have a Masculine Extroverted Decider tend to speak more bluntly with people.
