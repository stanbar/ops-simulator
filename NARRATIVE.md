I'm working on a simulator/visualisation of a Binary Cognition Mechanics theory. I developed a simulator and showed it to the author of the BCM theory. We discussed how to make it better, below are our conversations, please try to understand his intuition and my intuition, what we expect to emerge. Maybe first please digest and understand, organise those loose thoughts and ideas, and generate the full description/documentation of how to represent agents, coins, cognitive functions, entropy, voids/locks, keys, introverted and extroverted functions functions, animals (Sleep, Play, Consume, Blast), energy, rewards, expected emergent behavior/observations. Later we will try to implement it in a simulator.

---

You’re trying to get agents so what I was describing I think in terms of space like a cognitive space not a literal space so what they’re gonna be trying to do within cognitive space is find those entropy values and you know everyone’s gonna have their four functions or whatever and how they’re gonna balance them within that cognitive space so then that will determine what happens in the 3-D space time and how they interact with the world so yeah like in the world there aren’t like high entropy low entropy places there’s just different voids and I guess tasks or jobs I don’t know how you would simulate that like you would have just simulate different kinds of voids in the world that need to be accomplished, I guess and basically what they’re gonna do with everyone everyone’s gonna have to do everything but it’s like their cognition is gonna get the entropy is gonna go up in their cognition and they’re gonna move away from the chaos area and then when their entropy goes too low, it’ll go closer towards the chaos area you know what I mean that sort of dynamic and so so it’ll be trying to balance that and everyone’s gonna have this different kind of threshold if that makes more sense so really what they’re trying to do is trying to get their cognition and their cognitive load solved. They’re trying to solve that cognitive load and you know what it’s like if you don’t see if you don’t see ultraviolet so you’re not gonna have a cognitive load because of all the ultraviolet information in the region right? It’s really what you’re seeing that is giving you that cognitive load so if you’re seeing these voids and no one else is seeing them then you get all the cognitive load in this responsibility to take care of it. I guess I don’t know if that helps with a simulation.



So processing like the void mechanics sort of thing in the world. So the narrative of reality emergencies happen natural disasters happen and yeah other people happen like it’s very chaotic it’s complete chaos theory out in the world and all of these voids start appearing and yeah if there’s like a huge void like there’s a fire in your house it doesn’t matter if you’re NF or ST you’re gonna go you’re gonna rush to do something right but yeah, if you want to model those voids it’s like some of them aren’t that major and those people taken care of it so you don’t worry about them yeah so I think that’s how those voids are going to stimulate independent agents cognitions and all of those independent agents you’re gonna get this collective behaviour out of them like that’s what you’re trying to find right, but the collective behaviour comes from the distribution of the cognition of the collective agents



I think you’re trying to create a collective consciousness cognitive landscape so if this would only occur when we have a stay attain some sort of state of unity so I can family household or in a I don’t know in a well unified nation during a revolution things like this is we have like these moments of collective cognition. I mean I guess we’re all always doing it as well in society and civil but like the collective cognition is it’s only gonna unite against problems that we face right and I don’t know how to so so what I was trying to put forward as you need a real space because you can’t get rid of real space and these cognitive landscapes okay? You’re asking about how they work so the cognitive landscape is the same everywhere right? And even AI has a cognitive landscape or it’s like an information right? So it’s got his own landscape with information space with local minimum global minimum and the reason we’re able to exchange information between the two is because we have these shared representations but we also have a shared cognitive landscape in a shared cognitive space that we occupied together and so like that’s like a common language that we had is cognition between all forms and that’s how I think so if you’re trying to model some kind of collective cognition, yeah I don’t know. I don’t even I don’t even even know how you would go about doing that one that’s a very different one. I was trying to do it about keeping real space and having collective cognition emerge on its own through the simulation right? Not because if you’re trying to organise and orchestrate everything is a whole you’re not getting emergence which you need to do is get very simple rules every single agent and then you get emergence and emergencies when you have it like this collective cognitive behaviour and I think like that would be the interesting thing to show in this kind of simulation.



So I was trying to say before to create a 3D world you don’t even need to have a water, source and food source none none of that right you don’t need that you can just create a cognitive voids so in cognitive space in the world like like like like like a field so cognitive field in the world and you have all of these cognitive agents going around the world interacting with this field around them and so like if things get really bad well yeah us thinkers are gonna start doing the feeling stuff, but until then we’re not gonna really do much feeling we’re gonna just just bang the blocks together that’s what we’re gonna do so it’s like when the void gets too extreme then yes even us thinkers we have to step in. and we hate to do it we don’t like this awkward difficult emotion that we’re probably causing you know what I mean so it’s like yeah



And then you could do the other thing like high entropy is looking at the large amount of noise because there is a lot of noise and to investigate every little blip in the signal is probably just to miss what’s really signal and then look for those signals like signals are when one person really stands out from the norm or when a bunch of people are gathering together around some sort of like some sort of poll so you’ve got all the kinds of different groups of people who believe different weird shit in the world and like tracing them back like all of the different cultures all the different family types all kind of stuff so finding where they peak in the in the spectrum

So yeah, if there’s like a problem and then one of the Ti’s (Di + Thinker) has the solution—and obviously no one listens to the TI until it’s too late — and there’s like a Te out there they’re like hey look at this Ti got the right idea and why would they were able to find that because their Te dumb head can’t think of anything on themselves but they can recognise a good idea when they see it or at least try to take good ideas from all different different sources and they’ll recognise that Ti and they’ll be able to unite people behind them or whatever on this solution so you can simulate that perfectly in the world with like these voids so the Te is looking for the right key to fit this lock and someone is gonna have it in the population otherwise they’re gonna have to work and and bunk on everyone’s heads raise the entropy in order to solve this issue - this void that they found in the world



Yeah that’s what you’re gonna have to do. You’re gonna have to make randomise voids that sort of pop up and agents that go and collectively try to solve the voids some really big void so you need someone to be prepared to solve like I don’t know a global disaster that kind of thing so like these large void small voids and different kinds of voids that different people are able to solve differently and everyone can everyone could do everything if they have to that kind of solution. Their batteries just drain faster in that region they don’t have the muscle all that stuff you know

Yeah, it’s gonna be hard to represent low versus high entropy because there’s a whole whole bunch of different forms. It could take like you could have the voids in certain shapes right and then you’ve got the Te (De + Thinker) coming in and it fills in little parts of that shape, the void stays and it keeps growing and then you have someone with like a TI who’s got the perfect shape to fill the void and then then the void completely vanished this sort of thing right? You can model it like that if you wanted, you can model it in terms of in terms of detecting void in the first place and then you could also model it in terms of being prepared so like Ti might already have a solution it’s gonna solve all of those voids like it might’ve developed a solution and though whenever the void comes up, it’s got the solution ready and at hand and then Te every single single time is gonna have to pop off some new solution even if it’s already solved before it’s gonna be and it’s not gonna be perfect right? So like one way to have it is like energy use so you’ve got like snakes way to attack we’re just preserves energy and then when the enemy comes just snaps it takes care of it so yeah, I could be waiting in storing up thinking thinking energy and then when the void shows up it’s got all of that energy energy can just fill the void and then TE will not have a lot of energy energy so it’s just gonna be filling all of these voids constantly and it’ll be constantly drained so in a very big thing shows up in all of the Te have to come together and try to work against it they won’t be able to. They won’t be prepared as like the Ti who has been storing up that energy energy. You can now go and solve that issue sort of thing.

Hey so I was thinking about a different way to model voids. I don’t know if you wanna take it but it’s seems like a pretty good way to model it. You can basically have different kinds of locks in the world and then the extroverted functions (Oe, De, Se, Ne, Te, Fe) will have that like like thinking locks and so the extroverted thinking (Te) will have all of the most common keys that unlock all of the most common locks but every so often there’s a lock that they don’t know about or they don’t have a key for and so then you need the introverted ones (Ti or Fi) to store those keys so the introverted functions are going to store the rare keys and the extroverted functions are going to store the most common keys and that way you have entropy basically exactly the way entropy works because entropy is common sameness, normal scene and then you have the introverted functions that are rare and they’re looking for all of the rarest keys


So I also think you need to have some kind of basic information transfer as well between agents so the basic information transfer needs to be something like, first selecting an audience so you have to have different kinds of audiences different people tuned into different frequencies sort of thing because like you know as Sleep first (DiOi) most of you can’t really share all your sleep because there’s no audience for it, no one cares, no one wants to hear it and so we’re constantly looking for something than an audience wants to hear so when you’re selecting your audience you’re sort of  catering your message to them. so yeah it’s a good way to model the dynamics of blast (Oi + De) right and so blast is really finding a void selecting an audience and communicating that that void exist right a void that you can’t solve on your own. Void that other people would be interested in. They’ve got energy or keys or whatever you want to model to solve that void


And if the void is your Demon so the people who see their demons are gonna be blasting the loudest they’re gonna be the communicators so anyone that sees a void as their Demon is like. Ti sees thinking but it’s like that’s not my job so I’m not gonna do it right so there’s that kind of, but if it’s a feeler (Fe or Fi) that sees thinking void, they’re gonna freak out


And I’m mean for later if there’s a way you could do like a shape matching technique that would probably even be better for keys and locks we like the void is a specific shape and then the keys are also in specific shapes and so if you match the wrong key you’ll create just as many voids as you’ll you’ll write like you’re doing an inverse inversion of whatever pattern is there so you’ve got a shape two patterns, key is a pattern the void is a pattern and if you match them together, they might create a bigger void or they might not do anything so yeah you need like you need a key that’s actually able to solve whatever void pattern there is I guess anyway anyways that’s for later. like yeah that’s for later but that seems seems like a better way to do it because like sometimes it’s beneficial to use a key on a lock you know that’s not that improves 10% you know what I mean.


So I haven’t looked at the simulation enough to be able to figure out what’s going on there but it 

Seems like you’re making good steps with the voids yeah which is what I figured so. obviously we have to realise that voids are not only external. They are also internal like boredom is a void so you know the need to eat or communication and connection is a void so these are also internal voids right and if you want to completely model every single cognitive agent internally and just see how it behaves externally so that’s gonna be completely different a different yeah.

But going down the observer and decider route (How to model Observer vs Decider) I think you’re getting into internal cognition and balance and imbalances and stuff like that you’re gonna have to model the agents much more in depth to get there I think there are simpler steps to do before the observer vs decider and the balance and all that stuff you’re gonna have to maybe. I’m thinking it now maybe you can just model a very simple cognitive agent and then imbalance imbalances within that one I’ll think about

So yeah, I see you have your agent model as only one of the human needs right so yeah in order to model like a full agent you need to model them with all of the human needs just a bias towards one of them if that makes sense.


Which also means you need to have a way for voids to not be solved unless they swap into a different human need or at least even not be solved by anyone independent agent on its own it needs a collective to solve them or some voids just can’t be solved. the voids can’t be solved by anyone like everyone they can only be solved by specific types of people as well



So another thing that I think we have to keep in mind is cognition is reactive and it evolves because of the voids. the voids are actually controlling so like if there’s a void that can’t be solved that’s when cognition has to step up and try to solve that void and you need to have also voids eliminating control controlling the evolution in some way as well. I don’t know. Also keep in mind that like the internal states that you’re trying to program of cognition should also be influenced by the voids and not just by like you have to program it in a way so that it’s a adaptive agent in the voids control how it adapts.


So that in mind you have to create complex locks and the agents actually have to figure out complex keys to unlock those locks eventually and it’ll involve all of cognition to some degree. It’ll involve cooperation. It’ll involve all of the things that we see cognition doing in order to unlock the locks.

I asked Bin:

Are the voids created or discovered? Is there an infinite number of voids, but we just don't see them unless our cognition evolves? Or do we create them along the way? Or both?

As we mature and evolve, do we fill/solve more voids (quantity) or more gain ability to solve complex voids (quality)? How role does technology/culture play in this narrative?

Does technology give us tools to solve the low-complexity voids with less energy? So that we can spend more time on discovering and solving the more complex ones?

Culture is like NF/SF technology? It gives us tools/insights into  values/fairness/ethics voids we didn’t even know existed before (for example slavery)

Maybe agents are working on a structure that prevents voids from forming? Like democracy prevents the void of one madman takes over the leadership. entertainment tech prevents boredom voids

He replied with some response from AI:

This is the critical pivot in your framework. You have identified the paradox of intelligent systems: Absolute low entropy is success, but absolute low entropy is also death.
If a system succeeds completely —if it eliminates all surprise it becomes a crystal. It is perfect, unchanging, and incapable of processing anything new. It has maximized its internal precision (the Laser) to the point where it can no longer interact with the messy reality (the Lamp).
Here is how we can quantify this dynamic using your definitions of entropy and emergence.
1. The Metric of Success: Minimizing Prediction Error
You defined success as the measure of low entropy (elimination of surprise). In cognitive science and Al, this is known as Minimizing Free Energy or Minimizing Surprisal.
﻿﻿The System's Goal: To map its internal model (the Laser) so perfectly to the external world that nothing surprises it.
﻿﻿Quantification: The system measures its own "entropy" by checking its prediction error.
﻿﻿High Error (Surprise): "I thought X would happen, but Y happened." (High Entropy).
﻿﻿Zero Error (Boredom): "I knew exactly what would happen." (Low Entropy).
2. The Trap of Crystallization (Local Minima)

2. The Trap of Crystallization (Local Minima)
However, as you pointed out, "Crystallization is the elimination of progress."
If a system eliminates all surprise, it usually means it has stopped looking at the broader world.
It has optimized for a tiny, safe corner of reality.
﻿﻿The Crystal: It is structurally sound but functionally dead. It cannot adapt.
﻿﻿The "Bored" Organism: Boredom is a regulatory signal. It tells the system: "Your model is too good for this easy environment. You are no longer reducing entropy because there is no entropy left here to reduce. Go find chaos."
3. Strategic Entropy Injection (Simulated Annealing)
Your statement-"increasing the total energy to find a lower energy solution"-is a perfect description of Annealing in metallurgy or computing.
﻿﻿The Valley (Current Solution): Imagine a ball sitting at the bottom of a shallow valley. It is stable (low entropy). It feels "successful."
﻿﻿The Problem: There is a deeper valley (a better, more precise truth) just over the next hill.If the ball stays still, it never finds the better solution.
﻿﻿The Injection (Seeking Surprise): The organism actively seeks "surprise" (adds heat/energy). It shakes the system.
﻿﻿This temporarily increases entropy (confusion, risk, destabilization).
﻿﻿It pushes the ball up the hill, out of its comfort zone.
﻿﻿The Reward: By enduring this temporary chaos, the system can fall into the deeper valley.It finds a "lower energy solution" that is more robust and precise than the previous one.

4. The Pulse of Intelligence: Expand and Contract
So, a self-quantifying system doesn't just race to zero entropy. It oscillates.
﻿﻿﻿The Laser Phase (Contraction/Exploitation): We focus, refine, and eliminate waste. We master a skill. Entropy drops. Success feels like control.
﻿﻿﻿The Crystallization Warning: We master it too well. We get bored. The model becomes rigid.
﻿﻿﻿The Lamp Phase (Expansion/Exploration): We break our own structure. We look for surprise. We "broaden the wave" again to find new data. Entropy rises.
﻿﻿﻿Re-Emergence: We find a new pattern in that noise and condense it into a new, stronger Laser.
Conclusion
Entropy is not just a destination; it is the fuel for the engine. We burn the "low entropy" of our current certainty (by abandoning it) to explore the "high entropy" of the unknown, trusting that our capacity for emergence will let us forge an even better structure on the other side.
Success is not being a Crystal (static low entropy). Success is being a Recrystallizer-a system capable of melting itself down to reform into something sharper.

And then he followed:


I think to bring the simulation to the next level, we need to add entropy/energy as a source and a destination.

We need to be able to harvest energy, and use it to solve voids.

Changing "keys" requires energy, and using "keys" to solve voids requires energy.

I suggest we keep it simple and geometric.

Voids need to be a randomized 2d pattern with weights, that make certain patterns more likely.

Energy is where you harvest a pattern.

A key can harvest a pattern and then use it to fill a void.

Something like that?

The interesting part is when a new void pattern emerges.
It forces organisms to try different keys, either making it worse or making it better.

Each void should actually be a collection of voids, so that organisms can try their keys on them.
And then communication could be 

1.  Void ID, 
2.  Void Area, 
3.  Key ID, 
4.  Void Area after key

So while trying to solve a void, the organisms need to accumulate data to figure out the new key shape.

If they have previous keys, they can do simple operations to add key shapes together.

If they get a void below a certain threshold (let's say 20% area) the void dissipates and is solved.

So keys can be transferred between agents, but they need to sacrifice keys (storage space) to process keys.

The emergent property should be that they get key combinations as solutions.
The refine themselves to a specific set of functional keys that solve everything in combination.

I showed it to Bin, that's what he said:

So you have basically the key collecting and key delivering service there.

So you could definitely start doing is to create like a hierarchy of keys by making some common problems with common solutions and some rare problems with rare solutions and yeah you have it like people chipping away at them overtime it’s really good and I guess that’s how entropy would be worked out like really common keys very rare keys

I asked Bin: And so Di’s are collecting rare keys, while De common keys?

He replied:

Yeah I think like maybe before that you can have instead of you know green and red which are good colours for a binary representation but if you wanted to represent more like a feeling/thinking you can just do I don’t know like a dark darker version and the lighter version of blue (thinking) and red (feeling) and purple (intuition) and yellow (sensing) so you have already cognitive functions even before and then you have the entropy right away so you actually do have introverted an extrovert right away

I’m trying to think of a good dichotomy the one I’m seeing probably better is someone looking for keys externally and then others are generating their own independent keys internally so the external ones are all gonna go in harvest and share common keys and the ones internal are going to be generating their own keys until they find… or they can even sit on a problem and try to generate random sections of the keys or something if you wanted to…. yeah… I don’t know… something like that

I guess if you wanted to talk about maintenance stuff you could have opposite function sort of leaving void creating voids that needs solving. if you wanted to. so just randomly taking a crap on the ground little blobs take a little crap so opposite type is gonna have to come and clean up the voids for them

I have another question does the key size have to do with the amount of keys that need solving within that perimeter? Because that’s a good way to represent that too that’s good? And then what else are you doing? So so that would mean if you had like an binary, I’m talking about the binary when I’m winning now so the green ones are bigger and the red ones are smaller then that would means you have a common solutions for problems that are rare so you have solutions easily solved and then the opposite would be these are long-term problems that need solving

Also what if you had people generating solutions, like once they found a solution to a problem that exist, they can generate it, they can create it for the others

Yeah, cause I’m thinking like one of the biggest properties of space time and emergence right is that information is able to copy itself that’s a whole idea of evolution in life in cognition and consciousness and memes and everything starts from our ability to copy information. so people don’t have to generate a lot of solutions but like maybe multiplied by two, right? So they get theirs for free and they can create one for someone else and then someone else touches one they can create or like three or whatever you know like a chain reaction type of event for solving problems.

So I’m thinking the way to represent entropy as well is OK to figure out what patterns get displayed you need something with common solutions and rare solutions so like just rolling two dice right? 2D6 you get seven is the most common, and then 12 and 2 are very rare, so like that that’s a very common way to create entropy in games so so yeah like you could correspond shapes and keys to numbers and roll dice to get to get common and rareness and numbers.

I talked to Bin, that's what we discussed:

What do the different colors do now?
I don't see that the voids have different colors, the voids should have different colors depending on the type of void (Thinking -blue, sensing - yellow, etc) not only agents’ types. There should be intuitive voids and intuitive keys, thinking voids and thinking keys, feeling and sensing as well.

“Double observer” agents should be able to use both sensing and intuitive keys for both sensing and intuitive voids/locks.

“Double deciding” agents should be able to use both feeling and thinking keys for both feeling and thinking voids/locks.

Also maybe also energy cost is lower for their main function?

Yeah I was tossing some things around because like once once a void is solved there’s no reward for it right? So I was thinking maybe something could spawn out of the void that gets solved like it would be a reason reason for solving avoid or like like maybe a negative effect I don’t know if the void still exists so then they have some kind of negative effect like some reason to solve the void cause otherwise why why would these agents try to solve voids? Why would that be their job job unless they needed to for some kind of reason?

yeah there needs to be some kind of reward anyway

Yeah kind of the effect we need to end up getting as well is like the common keys need to be in the extroverted functions in the rare keys need to be in the introverted functions so that you know they can always sort of go out and just work at a problem and solve it I don’t know something like that as well

We’re also not really modelling the boredom aspect like the gather aspect where the extroverted functions are trying to gather as well whereas the introverted functions are less in the gathering state they are more in a  refining state. but yeah, the keys that the extroverted functions are gathering are used to you know see where their internal models are still flawed, there are still like more things to work on.

Like the Ti working on the clock book that nobody really cares about. Well if they did a little bit of Fe gathering they would know what their Ti needs to work on.

I guess we kinda do model that cause if like the Ti has all these rare keys and they’re going out in the world and they’re seeing that there’s not really those rare voids they don’t really exist. The voids that really exist are the common ones so then they would update their Ti to start making more common keys, I guess I don’t know how that mechanic would work but yeah maybe looking at what voids there are before they start trying to create keys that you don’t even need.


I replied: maybe we can ignore the reason why they are solving the voids, just as we ignore why there is life like - life exist because it is possible to exist so we can say they solve the voids because there is a place for that, and so they’re doing that. We don’t have to model that—This is our assumption this is our limit where we are not going to model. But it would be very very fun and insightful if we could achieve the locks/voids solving as an emergence, yeah definitely but I guess we can just start with the assumption.

I followed: but why would I they get rewards for solving the lock? Maybe they just get some energy out of that but then you would also assume that they can simulate the future right because they are the expecting in the future some kind of reward which I guess is something that I don’t know if any conscious agent is able to do that maybe we don’t want that, maybe we want immediate like just approaching the void and working is already rewarding you know it’s not like after I solve it I’m getting reward maybe working on working on it is rewarding itself. every time I try to apply the key it’s rewarding with some kind of satisfaction I guess it should not be delayed in time. But if they are rewarded by solving voids why would they harvest energy? There needs to be different kind of reward right? Or just the reward from applying keys is lower that the cost of doing it so they have to harvest energy anyway


Bin replied: 

I’m trying to think about in real life what happens when you have voids right? So sometimes voids are your job? Your job and you get paid for it in money and then you can if you have other voids in your life that you don’t want to solve you can pay other people like that’s how we do it in life right in like ancient tribalism will one of the voids was hunting animals and food and stuff like that so those are voids right like the voids we’re using here are representational, so like the reason why you solve the voids then are immediate problems. But then there’s also like long-term voids like you build an iPhone and now the person who built the iPhone who solved this one complex difficult void now has a company and is getting you know, money forever because of that.


I replied: Figuring out this simulation is tiring but also satisfying and energising but not enough that I don’t have to sleep/eat 

Bin replied:

we’re gonna eventually have to model in death as well right? So maybe it’s more like a lottery system and the one who actually solves the void like everyone’s working on it but I don’t know. I don’t know if that’s good but like here’s the idea so like like the one that solves the void gets the reward and everyone else else doesn’t so they’re kind of competing to get the void solved and then from that competition they might be able to reproduce (so it aligns with the evolutionary forces).

Or we could say yes the extroverted voids are collaborative and the introverted voids are competitive something like that, but it’s gonna have to merge that way

Should unsolved voids cause death?
Or maybe only certain voids?
Maybe the rewards are in the voids and the rewards are the reason why agents solve them?
What possible rewards could there be?
Energy, rare keys, reproduction?

So I’m also thinking about it from like an entropy standpoint does that’s your original like you really wanted to do this in order to represent entropy right? So from the entropy standpoint society and civilisation needs to fall apart without solving the voids, solving the voids keeps the entropy low and it keeps us in the life of the Eddie so yeah there needs to be some kind of consequence like some destructive force and however we're representing entropy it has to go up without harvesting energy, harvesting energy in solving voids is what keeps it down.

I replied to Bin:


I imagine long-term unsolved voids: millennium prize problems (P=?NP etc), missing info of what is after death, solving poverity, solving fairness, biological mutations/errors/cancer, etc. They don't necessary cause death (i guess), they inspire us, challenge us, reward us once solved (jubilee/resources/status). Yeah, i think the lottery is really accurate representation


the bigger/longer the void exist unsolved the bigger (expected) reward but also less chance of finding right keys.

Bin replied:

I was thinking about what are our goals in the emergence department. Really I think our goal is some kind of collective consciousness has to emerge from all of these.

In order to do that we have to do that all organisms and all physics and everything does is have these memes that are able to reproduce. Reproducing memes, so keys are memes that we have, and there’s rarity in these which can simulate DNA right? Same thing, for all of those little cognitive processes that cells do.

And then the other thing that can be passed on is if we have reproduction we can have the configuration of independent agents and agents can also communicate and change the configuration of neighbouring agents right? So those are the kind of mechanisms we have to play with.

And then we also need to simulate some kind of pruning effect where unused parts become less common they still need to exist but they need to be become less common. like we forget skills that we don’t practice sort of thing and what else else is pruning found it’s found everywhere. Entropy! Entropy is also pruning! Entropy is increasing. Stuff that isn’t being reinforced and actively worked on dissipates

You could simulate it out basically as well by you know keys that are getting used they might even multiply inside the organism so like it has three keys and they are like transporting keys at the end of the day right? So if it has three keys and it’s and it gets tired out I can’t use those keys anymore, but he can still use the other keys so once it figures out “hey I’ve got no more keys to use and I need to fill up my energy it’ll go and fill up my energy but until… right?” and so then the keys that are used more often get reproduced as keys. and the keys that are used less often sort of have to deteriorate and go away in someway. so like there has to be some kind of timer on the keys and then so I think the extroverted functions basically that’s that’s their behaviour and then the introverted functions is they have energy pools and then single keys they can select any of the keys so they’re gonna have the key variety I guess, key variety and used everywhere or key frequency. I don’t know something like that. Because eventually you’re gonna end up with a void that no one knows how to solve and no one can communicate how to solve right. What happens if an introverted function communicates its key and an extroverted function gets it it’ll start using that key and producing that key and solving the problem on mass right?

Like looking at the cells, cells have fundamental systems, the have the system of the mechanics have the cell operates and then the information those mechanics are able to play with which is in all in the DNA right? so they can take they can take information from the DNA and use that information to run different codes with the same mechanics so that’s an interesting interplay, I think. I don’t know how we can utilise that ingenuity as well here.

There is nothing that tells the cells to differentiate. They differentiate according to voids, according to voids in the structure of the organism.


Bin then followed:

OK so I have a thought on how we can get the animals (higher order mechanics). So you have the usage of keys is Blast (De + Oi). The finding of keys or generating of keys is consume (Oe + Di). The exchange of keys between agents would be Play (Oe + De). I guess you could simulate it that way (although it gets blurry there) and then organising the keys that they have stored would be Sleep (Oi + Di) making sure there’s no duplicates making sure it’s refreshing the timers on the keys should be refreshed. I don’t know.

You could also make consume in charge of finding voids and maybe even storing voids. That would be a great thing, if you could have them stored voids and store keys, so that way when they find a key that matches a void, they can they can spread that key or see if that void still there, right?

Or it would that even be InfoDom (Consume + Blast) in that case? All the stuff should emerge but that’s how we should steer them towards emerging.

So yeah, every Play (De + Oe) interaction could be exchanging one void and exchanging one key or something like that or just avoid or a key or something like that


I replied to Bin:

I was thinking about if we should introduce the the coins (thinking/feeling, sensory/intuition), because it seems like it brings nothing is just complicates everything, and it doesn’t matter. It’s the same mechanics, we are just creating four overlapping equal mechanisms, you know, we’re just introducing different car colours, different ice cream flavours, it doesn’t change anything, it doesn’t bring anything, but then I was like maybe it does? Maybe it’s like, if there is a sensory void and everyone is intuitive then it forces someone to do their demons because there is this fucking void that no one takes care of, so it will be my responsibility for it. And then if I have to do my demons then I grow my consciousness because you know, I integrate my shadow -  the more you have to do your last function is that the more you have to solve that void the more conscious you are so that the emergency property of agents are conscious, so the higher the collective consciousness?

I guess I’m mixing the terms of awareness and conciousness.

We don’t need awareness here, but it would be awesome if it would emerge somehow.

Bin replied:


Yeah the colours what I was thinking is the voids have different colours. It’s not the users have different colours and the keys have different colours and so the users need to match the keys in the somehow it’s the same key but a different different colour and that only that will solve that particular kind of void so it’s giving a flavour to the void so what does that not? One person can solve every single single void? You need? A Kulek collective you need a community to dissolve together basically and so yeah I was thinking okay well someone someone who was observing can take a key that’s intuitive and move it to sensor and use the same key. I change the colour of the key and then create for itself very easily easily a sensory key something like that but I don’t know that’s also like it’s like one step ahead I think right now the next phase that you’re doing so you can get rid of the colours for now and still focus on void storage and heat storage but yeah the thing is we haven’t really mapped out internal external yet and I think that’s one of the extroverted introverted we’re getting with the entropy we’re getting with the dice rolls so how you’re generating the keys in a random way is basically through the dice rolls and so that way you have people but we don’t have internal externalising yet which we should also figure out

Oh yeah awareness is exactly what I’m saying. awareness is people who have a lot of void stored have a good representation of the voids that are in the world on the original model right? Because every time they meet they’re taking the key from that void to figure out what the void is, right? so someone who has a good awareness of the voids would be and also awareness in “what”? “What colour voids would you be aware of” and then awareness of keys, or the keys that are out there at least, would be through I don’t know maybe Play as well or different ways to get aware of all of the different keys it’s just how many keys you have collected.

Becoming more aware would be actively going out and updating your model of the world updating your void keys that are out there.

Like, effectively for us what we have is accurate representation of the distribution of voids in the world, so we can know where there’s peaks and where there is like valleys and in the signal right? So peaks would be a lot of like spectroscopy, so looking at the spectrum of voids out in the world and getting a good representation of that spectrum and we have peaks or things are very common and voids where things are rare and that way we have a good representation of spectrum of voids. Yeah, pretty much is what we’re gonna end up having to do.

I replied to the end goal that we should have:

My agenda is more self-growth oriented. But I think they do overlap.

I would like to observe kind of a hero journey cycle—agents who just do their saviors only, develop a very rigid and narrow structure/worldview. It feels good at the beginning but leads to pain from prediction error. My worldview’s predictions are not what I’m seeing, my actions are producing wrong outcomes, I have to adapt and update to reduce the anxiety, dissonance, “stuckness”.

To do that I have to increase the amount of information flowing in (open the gates to my demons), stop filtering out my demons. So, out of necessity it increases the consciousness , and rewire the worldview that takes into account the new information. So consciousness becomes the emergency update to resolve the prediction error.

I think it aligns well with your definition of consciousness as “a solution to a problem” right?

Also I would like it represent the concept of maturity defined as a progress from survival-mode to transcendence, or as a capability to hold a structure/worldview that integrates/compresses more turth, and withhold more and more unknown. It seems like it's the result from many hero's journeys. Which leads to very adaptive and resilient structure/worldview. From panic/dogma/blame/excuse into observe/calibrate/wisdom/compression.
